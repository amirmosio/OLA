 - check the difference between slightly and non-stationary environment
 - In the simulation file, ucb1 algorithm, maybe instead of small t we should use capital T for the upper bound
 - check the algorithm of UCBWithInventoryConstraint in select_prices method. Make sure it is correct
    consider checking the optimization algorithm for calculating rho
